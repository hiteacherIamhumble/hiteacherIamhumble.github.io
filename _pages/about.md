Welcome! I'm Peter Dai, an educator and technology enthusiast passionate about making a positive impact through teaching and innovation.

With a commitment to lifelong learning, I strive to inspire others while continuously expanding my own horizons. My journey in education has been driven by the belief that knowledge should be accessible and transformative.

I'm particularly interested in leveraging technology to enhance educational experiences and create meaningful connections with students and colleagues alike. Whether through innovative teaching methods or collaborative projects, I'm always looking for ways to make learning more engaging and effective.
